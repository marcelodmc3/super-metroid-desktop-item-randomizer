# Super Metroid Desktop Item Randomizer
The **Super Metroid Desktop Item Randomizer** is an offline version of the famous [Super Metroid Item Randomizer](https://itemrando.supermetroid.run/) by [tewtal](https://github.com/tewtal).

It runs on **Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10** (32 and 64 bit versions) and creates ROM files that are identical to the ones generated by the [tewtal randomizer](https://itemrando.supermetroid.run/randomize).

With this application you are able to:
- **Pick a specific seed number** to generate a randomized Super Metroid ROM file.
- Generate **multiple randomized ROMs** at a time.
- Access an **spoilers file** containing all the randomized items locations.
- **Automatically** launch your preferred **SNES emulator**  with the newly ramdomized ROM file.
