# Super Metroid Desktop Item Randomizer
The **Super Metroid Desktop Item Randomizer** is an offline version of the famous [Super Metroid Item Randomizer](https://itemrando.supermetroid.run/) by [tewtal](https://github.com/tewtal).

It runs on **Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10** (32 and 64 bit versions) and creates ROM files that are identical to the ones generated by the [tewtal randomizer](https://itemrando.supermetroid.run/randomize).

This randomizer is available through an [installer](https://github.com/marcelodmc3/super-metroid-desktop-item-randomizer/releases/download/v1.0.0/SMDIRandomizer_1.0.0_Setup.exe) or a [porbable version](https://github.com/marcelodmc3/super-metroid-desktop-item-randomizer/releases/download/v1.0.0/SMDIRandomizer_1.0.0_Portable.zip).

With this randomizer you are able to:
- **Pick a specific seed number** to generate a randomized Super Metroid ROM file.
- Generate **multiple randomized ROM files** at a time.
- Access a **spoilers file** containing all the randomized items locations.
- **Automatically** launch your preferred **SNES emulator**  with the newly ramdomized ROM file.
